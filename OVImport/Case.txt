OMG! YES! YOU GOT A NEW JOB AS A CONSULTANT AT OVCHIPCARD BV. WOOH!
----

CASE DESCRIPTION
---

Your single sole purpose in life as the new developer is to make the transaction log
processor. You are very proud of this. Everyday people swipe their cards at the OV gates to gain access to the subway. 
The OV gate  then writes a little log entry to a csv file. 

This CSV file needs to be uploaded every night for batch processing to an OVtransaction REST API.

It needs to be as quickly as possible, as efficient as possible, and as stable as possible.

In short the process looks like this:

- Parse a CSV file
- Validate the fields
- Call the OV webservice, it can respond with.

	- {success = true} (everything is cool)
	- {success = false, error="card does not exist" } 
	- {success = false, error="user does not exist" }

Simple right?

But here's the catch:

This webservice has been written by CapGemini and therefore is not very stable or efficient. It tends to
crash, be unreachable or just be a jackass and be slow.

Your job is to make this to try this process to be as efficient as possible, to make sure it can handle
errous input data, and deal with a flaky webservice. If the job doesn't finish by 6 in the morning 
people might not be able to get it. SO ITS SUPERIMPORTANT that it finishes. Or at least as it best
attempt.

Additionaly, there are some superelite hackers on the subway system that make fake id cards with users that don't
exist in the system.

WHAT CAN YOU CHANGE?

Everything except the webservice and the CSV. This is made by CAP, so no one can change this ever except via
new
